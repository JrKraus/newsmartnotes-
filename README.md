Note smart application

Preference 
This was the most difficult project I have ever worked on. 
It was also the project I learned the most from. 
I started planning out note smart note on March 6th.  
Then I started coding on March 15th.  
I started uploading to GitHub on March 31.  
I worked each week, pulled all-nighters to get this project done. 
I am very proud of this project flaws and all.

How to set up the note smart
1.	Got to the package manger command prompt and use command Update-Database
2.	You must create an account and login into the application
3.	Create a notebook 
4.	Create a note and some tags
   
Accessibility and WCAG 2.1 AA
•	Keyboard Navigation 
Most functionalities can be accessed using the keyboard the only feature I couldn’t figure out is the notes list. Theres skip links and focus indicators along with a logical tab order
•	Color contrast  
Tests and background are styled in such a way to meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure readability. 
•	Accessible Forms 
All forms have <label> elements with clear error messages 
Known issues 

This section is for transparency and to make your job of grading a little easier. All functionalities work however they may have some User interface issues.  

UI issues

If you change the note title you will need to refresh the page to see the title change in the notes list column.  It does change the title on the back end but does not change it until you refresh 

When removing tags from a note if you rapidly remove multiple tags you may need to double click on remove or wait for the green text on the screen to disappear before remove a tag.  It does remove the tag from notes 

When you delete a note, it will say successful deleted. However, it will try to autosave the note that isn’t there so it gives a can’t save note error on the website. The note is deleted completely

AI usage 
The only time I used AI was in the project proposal which was to 
“I discovered that there are rich text editors’ libraries for JavaScript, 
but I didn’t know which one I should use. 
So, I asked ChatGPT to give me a list of the best 
rich text editors (R.T.E)  that are free.  
Then I narrowed down my search by asking if any of these have any issues with working with bootstrap.  
This allowed me to narrow down the search for the R.T.E I will use for this project. “
